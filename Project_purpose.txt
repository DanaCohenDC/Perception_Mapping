Perception mapping is a helping tool for making decisions. 
For example: You need to investigate why people in your company leave's it, 
therefore you have a list of all possible reasons from anonymous server. 
Now you want to understand which of the causes you would like to handle first. So what do you need to do? 

1. Create excel file with one column with title and your list.
2. play Perception_Mapping.py (I've created an exe file  but it was too big for github, sorry)
3. load your file
4. If one reason leads to another then fill it in the "leads to" column
5. If one reason conflicts with another then fill it in the "conflict3" column
6. Let the program calculate the score and find for you the blocker (the one in your list which you'll prefer to handle first). 

Finally, you can also see it in a graph and change "leds to" column values for other checks.
